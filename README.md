# TSV-to-wikitable
JPxG, January 2023

Converts a TSV input file to a table that works with MediaWiki markup.
Usage is like this:
>`python3 main.py uglytext.txt nicetable.txt`

If no arguments are given, the defaults are `input.txt` and `output.txt`.

This took me about five minutes to write. Do whatever you want with this.
